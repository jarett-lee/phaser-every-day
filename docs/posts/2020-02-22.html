<h2 id="set-up-phaser">Set up phaser</h2>
<p>I think what would get a game published the fastest is to start including phaser in my code.</p>
<p>Phaser has an official getting started guide, so I&#39;ll follow that: <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3">https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3</a></p>
<p>Looks like phaser uses <code>this</code> a lot, so I can&#39;t use lambda functions.</p>
<p>One issue I had to resolve first is that my html files were not loading the js bundles in my local development server, only in github pages. See below for how I fixed this.</p>
<p>I tried using the <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part5">JavaScript tutorial</a>, but I ran into an issue where &quot;this&quot; was any. I tried to define it as &quot;Phaser.Game&quot;, but &quot;game.load&quot; was still not a function. So I tried the <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/how-to-use-phaser-with-typescript">TypeScript tutorial</a>, but that tutorial is out of date. You can tell because it doesn&#39;t use the config file, but has a list of arguments instead. I went and combined the two.</p>
<p>I really hate the any type, so I didn&#39;t use it here. Here&#39;s the combined code</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">import Phaser from &quot;phaser&quot;;

class SimpleGame {
    game: Phaser.Game;

    constructor() {
        const config: Phaser.Types.Core.GameConfig = {

            height: 600,
            physics: {
                default: &quot;arcade&quot;,

        };

    }

    create(): void {

        const particles = (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).add.particles(&quot;red&quot;);

        const emitter = particles.createEmitter({
            speed: 100,
            scale: {start: 1, end: 0},
            blendMode: &quot;ADD&quot;,
        });

        const logo = (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).physics.add.image(400, 100, &quot;logo&quot;);

        logo.setVelocity(100, 200);
        logo.setBounce(1, 1);
        logo.setCollideWorldBounds(true);

        emitter.startFollow(logo);

<p>The annoying casts can be eliminated by moving the logic to a Scene.</p>

<h3 id="point-html-files-at-bundles-in-both-server-and-in-github-pages">Point html files at bundles in both server and in github pages</h3>
<p>What I did last time, pointing the html at <code>/phaser-every-day/\*.bundle.js</code>, broke my local server since it&#39;s not the same path.</p>
<p>I can do this with html-webpack-plugin. See: <a href="https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/477">https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/477</a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been avoiding html-webpack-plugin since it seemed like it&#39;d be yet another I&#39;d have to learn, but it looks like it handles most things for me without too much configuration.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const config = {
    plugins: [
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
        // new CopyPlugin([&quot;src/index.html&quot;]),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
    ],
};</code></pre>
<p>Put all the js files in one index.html file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">  &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;tic-tac-toe.bundle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;unknown-second-project.bundle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;posts.bundle.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Following the github issue, </p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const config = {
    plugins: [
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(),

            filename: &quot;projects/unknown-second-project/index.html&quot;,

<h4 id="give-a-template-to-htmlwebpackplugin">Give a template to HtmlWebpackPlugin</h4>
<p>Now, I want to give a template to HtmlWebpackPlugin. I think I&#39;d rather avoid learning ejs when my main goal is to learn Phaser, and I see that it looks like I can just use html files directly. So, I added the html as a template and I got an error.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            chunks: [&quot;tic-tac-toe&quot;],

            template: &quot;src/projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html&quot;,
        }),</code></pre>
<pre><code>    WARNING in Conflict: Multiple assets emit different content to the same filename projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html</code></pre><p>This is because file-loader and HtmlWebpackPlugin both try to write to that file. HtmlWebpackPlugin already handles writing the html to the same place as the compiled code, so I don&#39;t need it anymore. (Commented-out code is removed.)</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const config = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {

                    // {
                    //     loader: &quot;file-loader&quot;,

                    &quot;html-loader&quot;,

            },

    },

<p>Clean up:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove script tags from html files</li>
<li>remove html import from ts files</li>
<li>use HtmlWebpackPlugin to write the html files instead of file-loader</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="automate-adding-new-projects">Automate adding new projects</h4>
<p>This is a tangent, but I really want to do this. As an afterthought justification, the webpack will get really big really fast if I have to add like 8 lines every time I start a new project.</p>
<p>Idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>find all files and directories in src/projects/</li>
<li>filter out the valid directories</li>
<li>add a entry point for each scripts/index.ts and a HtmlWebpackPlugin for each index.html file</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dependencies-vs-devdependency">dependencies vs devDependency</h3>
<p><a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file">https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;dependencies&quot;: Packages required by your application in production.
&quot;devDependencies&quot;: Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So phaser is definitely a devDependency, but I might actually have more devDependencies than just that.</p>
<h3 id="phaser-doesnt-look-right-in-github-pages">Phaser doesn&#39;t look right in github pages</h3>
<p>Phaser doesn&#39;t look right in github pages (it&#39;s a bunch of neon green boxes) because I&#39;m loading the assets from an http url (<a href="http://labs.phaser.io">http://labs.phaser.io</a>) and github pages (correctly) blocks mixed content. I&#39;m actually glad this is the case, because it would be a security risk otherwise. The full visuals must wait until I get some files in my project itself.</p>
<h3 id="webpack-warns-about-large-asset-size">Webpack warns about large asset size</h3>
<pre><code>WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
This can impact web performance.
Assets: 
  tic-tac-toe.bundle.js (1.14 MiB)</code></pre><p>Phaser is big and it can be reduced using custom phaser builds where you exclude everything you don&#39;t need. This is not a concern for me right now, but eventually I might want to look into this.</p>

<h2 id="meta-thoughts">Meta thoughts</h2>
<p>I had trouble starting today. I work at 12:00 thinking about working on this project and I actually started at 16:00. On the bright side, I did start. I&#39;m practicing starting, and remembering that I could literally write a single line of code and I&#39;d be fine got me to start.</p>
<p>I set the bar too high with my first post. I won&#39;t have that kind of motivation every day and I don&#39;t have the time to be so thorough with every post if I do it every day. I still like the idea of a development blog, but I think I&#39;ll only write it for myself. Maybe eventually I&#39;ll write something for others, but I think I&#39;ll leave that to my actual personal blog.</p>
<p>It takes me too long to swap between committing my posts and my code separately, so I&#39;ll probably start doing a single post commit at the end and a single publish commit at the end.</p>
<p>Would it be faster for me to drop this project and start anew with a simpler website idea or would it be faster to finish making this website? Thinking solely about publishing games, this website is too complicated, but thinking about ease of code-share and distance between the code and the blog, I think I made the right choice. I think constant work is more important than optimal velocity (at the stage I&#39;m at) and there&#39;s probably not a big difference in coding velocity either way, so I&#39;ll just keep going the way I&#39;m going. (I also think I&#39;m a worrier and this might be a non-useful worry.)</p>
<p>Webpack seems really set on having your entry point be a JavaScript file. I wonder if it&#39;d be faster for me to make a react website. I bet there&#39;s some roadblocks for multiple projects within one repo &amp; website there as well.</p>
<p>I questioned whether or not I should learn Phaser again. I&#39;m definitely a worrier. Even if I learn an outdated game engine, I think I&#39;ll learn a lot, so just keep working.</p>
