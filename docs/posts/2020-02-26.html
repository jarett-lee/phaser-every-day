<p>It&#39;s definitely not ideal for me to be writing code one line at a time. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the point, thought. The point is to make coding the first thing I do when I get home instead of any other thing I do. I think that&#39;s the point. Maybe super minor, incremental changes is my path.</p>
<p>Today I refactored the drawO function.</p>
