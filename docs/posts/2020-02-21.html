<h1 id="point-the-html-files-at-the-bundles">Point the html files at the bundles</h1>
<p>Just doing the fastest way to point he index.html files at the bundle.js files today.</p>
<p>The bundle outputs to /docs/*.bundle.js, so I&#39;ll just point the html at /*.bundle.js since the docs is stripped out.</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t work because the base url is <a href="https://jarett-lee.github.io/phaser-every-day/">https://jarett-lee.github.io/phaser-every-day/</a>, so I have to point the html at /phaser-every-day/*.bundle.js.</p>
<h2 id="meta-notes">Meta notes</h2>
<p>I need to make sure to break up large tasks into small tasks, so that I can really complete 1 thing every day. The thing I do in a day might be just making a decision, not even implementing it.</p>
<p>I think I could have spent today better just researching whether or not to put the bundle.js next to my html files (/docs/projects/tic-tac-toe/bundle.js) or better to leave them at the top level folder (/docs/*.bundle.js). On the other hand, this is unimportant, so taking the simplest decision might be the right one.</p>
