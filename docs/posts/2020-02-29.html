<h2 id="stuff-i-did">Stuff I did</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll continue making the graphics library today.</p>
<p>The flow of events is...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Mouse click on canvas</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mouse click on graphical board</p>
</li>
<li><p>Selection on abstract board</p>
</li>
<li><p>Abstract board</p>
</li>
<li><p>Graphical board</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mouse clicks are passed in and board state is passed out.</p>
<p>Honestly, this feels like too much for a tic-tac-toe game. Let me stash some changes and see if I can push the project forward without these abstractions.</p>
<p>I made a winner checker. Then I merged in my previous graphics abstraction work, then I added a draw checker.</p>
<p>With such a small project, I can see the final product in my head from the start and I didn&#39;t really need any of the abstractions that I made. I&#39;m not a big fan of my architecture, but I&#39;m not sure if I want to mess with it at this point.</p>
<p>I added a game end notification.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-hobby">What is a hobby?</h2>
<p>I think a hobby should pick me up out of an emotional funk and get me in a better state of mind. This project is not necessarily doing that, but I need to remember why I&#39;m doing this project.</p>
<p>I&#39;m doing it because I want to learn Phaser. This first project helped me with that, so I was successful there. I also want to reshape my habits so that I start doing this stuff before any other hobbies, especially Reddit. On that front, I&#39;ve cut into my Reddit time, so I&#39;m successful there.</p>
<p>Now I feel better. Not in an ideal place, but better.</p>
