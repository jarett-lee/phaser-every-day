<p>I&#39;m inspired by this Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell&#39;s video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ">Cancer</a> to make an evolution simulation. This reminds me of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ">Primer&#39;s simulation videos</a> and <a href="https://ncase.me/">Nicky Case&#39;s edutainment games</a> as well. I can take inspiration from those to make this simulator.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also complicated enough to warrant more framework.</p>
<p>Let me go chronologically.</p>
<ol>
<li>I found sitting down to change one line of code didn&#39;t work because that line of code could actually be a regression if it was the wrong decision. Sitting down to make one decision about the code felt the same way. I need a dedicated block of time to sit down and work on the project. pannenkoek, creator of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A">SM64 - Watch for Rolling Rocks - 0.5x A Presses (Commentated)</a>, described this process well in his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K4OTAyampX1CueKyZUIunz0yIUYd3ldlQxv37oaySgs/view">FAQ</a>. You only have so much RAM in your brain. In order to work on a task, you need to load the relevant information into your RAM and then you can easily work on the project and see how things fit together. If you don&#39;t, then things won&#39;t match up. The best systems are made when the entire thing is loaded into RAM and constantly worked on, but most people can&#39;t do this due to concentration, time, financial, and other constraints. I think the public idea of Isaac Newton fits the bill - he thought about topics for a long time with intense focus and found novel ideas. However, this is not how I will be making this project. I will be making the project such that I can get started on any random part of the project and make an improvement in 1 hour. That means I need to break up the project into pieces such that each problem can be understood in 15 minutes, solved in 30 minutes, and implemented in 15 minutes.</li>
<li>In the FAQ, I also read how pannenkoek put myself in a very bad place in order to complete the project. I didn&#39;t feel bad-per-say for the last few days, but I didn&#39;t feel as good as I had for the previous two weeks. This got me down and unmotivated. Why was I programming if I got down because of it? But my goal is to explore whether or not creating things like this makes me purposeful or not. As of now, I think I&#39;m learning a bit, so that&#39;s good.</li>
