<p>by Jarett Lee on 2020-02-19</p>
<p>Here&#39;s my todo list from last time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the markdown post files /posts/2020-02-19.md</li>
<li>Put the js bundles next to their corresponding project index.html file</li>
<li>Point the index.html script src to the corresponding js bundle</li>
<li>Maybe use the docs branch to post the compiled html</li>
<li>Get github to host the pages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="get-github-to-host-the-pages">Get github to host the pages</h2>
<p>I&#39;m planning on getting my /dist/index.html to show when you go to github today.</p>
<p>Currently, I turned on GitHub Pages and my README.md is being served at <a href="https://jarett-lee.github.io/phaser-every-day/">https://jarett-lee.github.io/phaser-every-day/</a>. I want my /dist/index.html file to be served instead.</p>
<p>It turns out, github pages doesn&#39;t support serving just any sub-folder, it has to be named docs. So, the first step is to point webpack to build into /docs/. This is an easy fix, just change the output path to docs.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// webpack.config.js
const config = {
    output: {
        filename: &quot;[name].bundle.js&quot;,
        path: path.resolve(
            __dirname,
            &quot;docs&quot;,
        ),
    },
};</code></pre>
<p>Next, I&#39;ll save and commit the docs. I read that it takes a while, so I&#39;ll get started on making the markdown post files while I wait as well.</p>
<p>(The change went through in less than an hour.)</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save-dev markdown-loader</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-js">// webpack.config.js
const config = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.md$/,
                use: [
                    {
                        loader: &quot;file-loader&quot;,
                        options: {
                            name: &quot;[path][name].html&quot;,
                            context: &quot;src&quot;,
                        },
                    },
                    &quot;extract-loader&quot;,
                    &quot;html-loader&quot;,
                    &quot;markdown-loader&quot;,
                ],
            },
        ],
    },
};</code></pre>
<p>This will copy the markdown files to their destination, but only if they&#39;re loaded. Files are loaded if they&#39;re imported from a js-equivalent file and when they&#39;re set as an entry point. I want every file in the posts folder to be loaded. I did this using entry points and adding every post file as an entry point. I implemented this solution over including every file since I remember having trouble doing that in previous projects.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">// webpack.config.js
module.exports = (env, argv) =&gt; {
    const postsDir = path.join(__dirname, &quot;src&quot;, &quot;posts&quot;);
    config.entry[&quot;posts&quot;] = fs
        .readdirSync(postsDir)
        .filter(file =&gt; path.extname(file) === &quot;.md&quot;)
        .map(file =&gt; path.relative(__dirname, path.join(postsDir, file)))
        // TODO find a nicer way to add the preceding dot
        .map(file =&gt; &quot;./&quot; + file);

    return config;
};</code></pre>

<h3 id="webpack-html-entry-point">webpack html entry point</h3>
<p>What if... I could specify index.html as the entry point and webpack would include all the js files from there? This probably can&#39;t happen since I think the idea is that the same js file can be used from multiple html files. But I think this idea is looking into.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s some people talking about this idea: <a href="https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/536">https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/536</a>. I&#39;ll wait until this has more official support.</p>
