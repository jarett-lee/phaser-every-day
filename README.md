# Phaser every day

I want to see if I enjoy making and publishing games, so I want to work on it every day.

I have some self-imposed rules. In this repo, I'll work solely towards the goal of publishing games. If I want to play around with a game concept that I'm not currently working on, then that goes somewhere else. Constantly evaluate your own choices and write them down in a daily journal. No hard goals. There's no way to fail, I have years. Just set a direction and move towards that direction.
