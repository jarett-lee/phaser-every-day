# Point the html files at the bundles
Just doing the fastest way to point he index.html files at the bundle.js files today.

The bundle outputs to /docs/\*.bundle.js, so I'll just point the html at /\*.bundle.js since the docs is stripped out.

This doesn't work because the base url is https://jarett-lee.github.io/phaser-every-day/, so I have to point the html at /phaser-every-day/\*.bundle.js.

## Meta notes

I need to make sure to break up large tasks into small tasks, so that I can really complete 1 thing every day. The thing I do in a day might be just making a decision, not even implementing it.

I think I could have spent today better just researching whether or not to put the bundle.js next to my html files (/docs/projects/tic-tac-toe/bundle.js) or better to leave them at the top level folder (/docs/\*.bundle.js). On the other hand, this is unimportant, so taking the simplest decision might be the right one.
