I'm inspired by this Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell's video on [Cancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AElONvi9WQ) to make an evolution simulation. This reminds me of [Primer's simulation videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ) and [Nicky Case's edutainment games](https://ncase.me/) as well. I can take inspiration from those to make this simulator.

It's also complicated enough to warrant more framework.

Let me go chronologically.

1. I found sitting down to change one line of code didn't work because that line of code could actually be a regression if it was the wrong decision. Sitting down to make one decision about the code felt the same way. I need a dedicated block of time to sit down and work on the project. pannenkoek, creator of [SM64 - Watch for Rolling Rocks - 0.5x A Presses (Commentated)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A), described this process well in his [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K4OTAyampX1CueKyZUIunz0yIUYd3ldlQxv37oaySgs/view). You only have so much RAM in your brain. In order to work on a task, you need to load the relevant information into your RAM and then you can easily work on the project and see how things fit together. If you don't, then things won't match up. The best systems are made when the entire thing is loaded into RAM and constantly worked on, but most people can't do this due to concentration, time, financial, and other constraints. I think the public idea of Isaac Newton fits the bill - he thought about topics for a long time with intense focus and found novel ideas. However, this is not how I will be making this project. I will be making the project such that I can get started on any random part of the project and make an improvement in 1 hour. That means I need to break up the project into pieces such that each problem can be understood in 15 minutes, solved in 30 minutes, and implemented in 15 minutes.
2. In the FAQ, I also read how pannenkoek put myself in a very bad place in order to complete the project. I didn't feel bad-per-say for the last few days, but I didn't feel as good as I had for the previous two weeks. This got me down and unmotivated. Why was I programming if I got down because of it? But my goal is to explore whether or not creating things like this makes me purposeful or not. As of now, I think I'm learning a bit, so that's good.
