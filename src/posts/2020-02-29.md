## Stuff I did
I'll continue making the graphics library today.

The flow of events is...
* Mouse click on canvas
* Mouse click on graphical board
* Selection on abstract board

* Abstract board
* Graphical board

Mouse clicks are passed in and board state is passed out.

Honestly, this feels like too much for a tic-tac-toe game. Let me stash some changes and see if I can push the project forward without these abstractions.

I made a winner checker. Then I merged in my previous graphics abstraction work, then I added a draw checker.

With such a small project, I can see the final product in my head from the start and I didn't really need any of the abstractions that I made. I'm not a big fan of my architecture, but I'm not sure if I want to mess with it at this point.

I added a game end notification.

## What is a hobby?
I think a hobby should pick me up out of an emotional funk and get me in a better state of mind. This project is not necessarily doing that, but I need to remember why I'm doing this project.

I'm doing it because I want to learn Phaser. This first project helped me with that, so I was successful there. I also want to reshape my habits so that I start doing this stuff before any other hobbies, especially Reddit. On that front, I've cut into my Reddit time, so I'm successful there.

Now I feel better. Not in an ideal place, but better.
