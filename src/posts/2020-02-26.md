It's definitely not ideal for me to be writing code one line at a time. I don't think that's the point, thought. The point is to make coding the first thing I do when I get home instead of any other thing I do. I think that's the point. Maybe super minor, incremental changes is my path.

Today I refactored the drawO function.
