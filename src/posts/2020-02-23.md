I got to drawing the tic tac toe board, adding interaction, and starting on the game state.

## Tic-tac-toe

Finally, I'm at the point where I can start developing. (I really want to add unit tests right now as well, but I'll put that on hold.)

I'm starting with the draw functions so that I can visually debug the code.

Search here to find phaser 3 examples: https://phaser.io/examples/v3/search?search=line

This is pretty much all I needed for this: https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/game-objects/graphics/line-thickness

```js
function create () {
    var graphics = this.add.graphics();

    graphics.lineStyle(20, 0x2ECC40);

    graphics.strokeRect(50, 50, 100, 40);

    graphics.strokeCircle(600, 400, 64);

    graphics.beginPath();

    graphics.moveTo(400, 100);
    graphics.lineTo(200, 278);
    graphics.lineTo(340, 430);
    graphics.lineTo(650, 80);

    graphics.closePath();
    graphics.strokePath();
}

```

Next to add interaction. My intuitive thought is to add interaction via mouse. I considered using keyboard briefly, but on phones especially, tapping is the way to go.

Here's the mouse down example: https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/input/mouse/mouse-down#

```js
function preload () {
    this.load.image('logo', 'assets/sprites/phaser.png');
}

function create() {
    this.input.on('pointerdown', function (pointer) {
        console.log('down');
        this.add.image(pointer.x, pointer.y, 'logo');
    }, this);
}

```

Now to handle board state. I'm a fan of using a single array and having accessors.

## Minor things

### max-statements
https://eslint.org/docs/rules/max-statements

I like this rule, but it's too distracting. eslint highlights the whole function and it doesn't make it easy to figure out where the issue is.

### Make webpack resolve from project root

I'm planning on having a shared library, so I want to have an alias for the library. The simple step is to add an alias to webpack, but that's not it. I have to make eslint and vscode understand the alias as well.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const config = {
    resolve: {
        alias: {
            lib: path.resolve(__dirname, "src/lib/"),
        },
    },
};
```

https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-import-resolver-webpack

```bash
npm install eslint-import-resolver-webpack --save-dev
```

```js
// .eslintrc.js
module.exports = {
  settings: {
    "import/resolver": "webpack",
  },
}
```

tsconfig.json
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./",                          /* Base directory to resolve non-absolute module names. */
    "paths": {                                /* A series of entries which re-map imports to lookup locations relative to the 'baseUrl'. */
      "lib/*": ["src/lib/*"]
    },
  }
}
```

In the future when I add jest, I'll also have to configure jest's moduleNameMapper.

2020-03-04 Update: jest.config.js
```js
module.exports = {
    roots: ["<rootDir>/src"],
    moduleNameMapper: {"^lib/(.*)$": "<rootDir>/lib/$1"},
};
```
