Today, I got phaser-every-day on my phone. I use the app Working Copy and I really enjoy the experience of using this app. It has all the basic git features (pull, push, rebase), some nice additional features (rebase pull, push on commit, markdown preview), and it has a nice interface.

I also updated my index.html.
