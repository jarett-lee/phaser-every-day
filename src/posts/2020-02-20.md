Here's my todo list from last time:

* Load the markdown post files /posts/2020-02-19.md
* Put the js bundles next to their corresponding project index.html file
* Point the index.html script src to the corresponding js bundle
* Maybe use the docs branch to post the compiled html
* Get github to host the pages

## Get github to host the pages

I'm planning on getting my /dist/index.html to show when you go to github today.

Currently, I turned on GitHub Pages and my README.md is being served at https://jarett-lee.github.io/phaser-every-day/. I want my /dist/index.html file to be served instead.

It turns out, github pages doesn't support serving just any sub-folder, it has to be named docs. So, the first step is to point webpack to build into /docs/. This is an easy fix, just change the output path to docs.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const config = {
    output: {
        filename: "[name].bundle.js",
        path: path.resolve(
            __dirname,
            "docs",
        ),
    },
};
```

Next, I'll save and commit the docs. I read that it takes a while, so I'll get started on making the markdown post files while I wait as well.

(The change went through in less than an hour.)

## Load markdown post files

https://github.com/peerigon/markdown-loader

```bash
npm install --save-dev markdown-loader
```

```js
// webpack.config.js
const config = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.md$/,
                use: [
                    {
                        loader: "file-loader",
                        options: {
                            name: "[path][name].html",
                            context: "src",
                        },
                    },
                    "extract-loader",
                    "html-loader",
                    "markdown-loader",
                ],
            },
        ],
    },
};
```

This will copy the markdown files to their destination, but only if they're loaded. Files are loaded if they're imported from a js-equivalent file and when they're set as an entry point. I want every file in the posts folder to be loaded. I did this using entry points and adding every post file as an entry point. I implemented this solution over including every file since I remember having trouble doing that in previous projects.

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = (env, argv) => {
    const postsDir = path.join(__dirname, "src", "posts");
    config.entry["posts"] = fs
        .readdirSync(postsDir)
        .filter(file => path.extname(file) === ".md")
        .map(file => path.relative(__dirname, path.join(postsDir, file)))
        // TODO find a nicer way to add the preceding dot
        .map(file => "./" + file);

    return config;
};
```

```bash
# .gitignore
/docs/posts.bundle.js
```

## Ideas

### webpack html entry point

What if... I could specify index.html as the entry point and webpack would include all the js files from there? This probably can't happen since I think the idea is that the same js file can be used from multiple html files. But I think this idea is looking into.

Here's some people talking about this idea: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/536. I'll wait until this has more official support.

### Coding vs Posting vs Publishing

| Git message prefix |            | Description                                   |
|--------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Post               | Posting    | Change to the /src/*.html and /src/*.md files |
| Publish            | Publishing | Change to the /docs/ files                    |
| (Other)            | Coding     | All other changes                             |
