Here's my todo list from last time:

* Load the markdown post files /posts/2020-02-19.md
* Put the js bundles next to their corresponding project index.html file
* Point the index.html script src to the corresponding js bundle
* Maybe use the docs branch to post the compiled html
* Get github to host the pages

I'm planning on getting my /dist/index.html to show when you go to github today.

Currently, I turned on GitHub Pages and my README.md is being served at https://jarett-lee.github.io/phaser-every-day/. I want my /dist/index.html file to be served instead.

It turns out, github pages doesn't support serving just any sub-folder, it has to be named docs. So, the first step is to point webpack to build into /docs/. This is an easy fix, just change the output path to docs.

```js
const config = {
    output: {
        filename: "[name].bundle.js",
        path: path.resolve(
            __dirname,
            "docs",
        ),
    },
};
```

Next, I'll save and commit the docs. I read that it takes a while, so I'll get started on making the markdown post files while I wait as well.
