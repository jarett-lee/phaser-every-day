## Set up phaser

I think what would get a game published the fastest is to start including phaser in my code.

Phaser has an official getting started guide, so I'll follow that: https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3

Looks like phaser uses `this` a lot, so I can't use lambda functions.

One issue I had to resolve first is that my html files were not loading the js bundles in my local development server, only in github pages. See below for how I fixed this.

I tried using the [JavaScript tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3/part5), but I ran into an issue where "this" was any. I tried to define it as "Phaser.Game", but "game.load" was still not a function. So I tried the [TypeScript tutorial](https://phaser.io/tutorials/how-to-use-phaser-with-typescript), but that tutorial is out of date. You can tell because it doesn't use the config file, but has a list of arguments instead. I went and combined the two.

I really hate the any type, so I didn't use it here. Here's the combined code

```ts
import Phaser from "phaser";

class SimpleGame {
    game: Phaser.Game;

    constructor() {
        const config: Phaser.Types.Core.GameConfig = {
            type: Phaser.AUTO,
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
            physics: {
                default: "arcade",
                arcade: {gravity: {y: 200}},
            },
            scene: {
                preload: this.preload,
                create: this.create,
            },
        };

        this.game = new Phaser.Game(config);
    }

    preload(): void {
        (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).load.setBaseURL("http://labs.phaser.io");

        (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).load.image("sky", "assets/skies/space3.png");
        (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).load.image("logo", "assets/sprites/phaser3-logo.png");
        (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).load.image("red", "assets/particles/red.png");
    }

    create(): void {
        (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).add.image(400, 300, "sky");

        const particles = (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).add.particles("red");

        const emitter = particles.createEmitter({
            speed: 100,
            scale: {start: 1, end: 0},
            blendMode: "ADD",
        });

        const logo = (this as unknown as Phaser.Scene).physics.add.image(400, 100, "logo");

        logo.setVelocity(100, 200);
        logo.setBounce(1, 1);
        logo.setCollideWorldBounds(true);

        emitter.startFollow(logo);
    }
}

window.onload = (): void => {
    new SimpleGame();
};

```

The annoying casts can be eliminated by moving the logic to a Scene.

```ts
import Phaser from "phaser";

class SimpleScene extends Phaser.Scene {
    preload(): void {
        this.load.setBaseURL("http://labs.phaser.io");

        this.load.image("sky", "assets/skies/space3.png");
        this.load.image("logo", "assets/sprites/phaser3-logo.png");
        this.load.image("red", "assets/particles/red.png");
    }

    create(): void {
        this.add.image(400, 300, "sky");

        const particles = this.add.particles("red");

        const emitter = particles.createEmitter({
            speed: 100,
            scale: {start: 1, end: 0},
            blendMode: "ADD",
        });

        const logo = this.physics.add.image(400, 100, "logo");

        logo.setVelocity(100, 200);
        logo.setBounce(1, 1);
        logo.setCollideWorldBounds(true);

        emitter.startFollow(logo);
    }
}

class SimpleGame {
    game: Phaser.Game;

    constructor() {
        const config: Phaser.Types.Core.GameConfig = {
            type: Phaser.AUTO,
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
            physics: {
                default: "arcade",
                arcade: {gravity: {y: 200}},
            },
        };

        this.game = new Phaser.Game(config);

        this.game.scene.add("scene", SimpleScene);
        this.game.scene.start("scene");
    }
}

window.onload = (): void => {
    new SimpleGame();
};

```

I'll end it here for today.


## Issues

### Point html files at bundles in both server and in github pages

What I did last time, pointing the html at `/phaser-every-day/\*.bundle.js`, broke my local server since it's not the same path.

I can do this with html-webpack-plugin. See: https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/477

I've been avoiding html-webpack-plugin since it seemed like it'd be yet another I'd have to learn, but it looks like it handles most things for me without too much configuration.

```js
const config = {
    plugins: [
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
        // new CopyPlugin(["src/index.html"]),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
    ],
};
```

Put all the js files in one index.html file.

```html
  <script type="text/javascript" src="tic-tac-toe.bundle.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="unknown-second-project.bundle.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="posts.bundle.js"></script></body>
```

Following the github issue, 
```js
const config = {
    plugins: [
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(),
        new CopyPlugin(["src/index.html"]),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            chunks: ["tic-tac-toe"],
            filename: "projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html",
        }),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            chunks: ["unknown-second-project"],
            filename: "projects/unknown-second-project/index.html",
        }),
    ],
};
```

This creates a nice, relative link.

```html
<!-- projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html -->
  <script type="text/javascript" src="../../tic-tac-toe.bundle.js"></script></body>
```

#### Give a template to HtmlWebpackPlugin

Now, I want to give a template to HtmlWebpackPlugin. I think I'd rather avoid learning ejs when my main goal is to learn Phaser, and I see that it looks like I can just use html files directly. So, I added the html as a template and I got an error.

```js
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            chunks: ["tic-tac-toe"],
            filename: "projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html",
            template: "src/projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html",
        }),
```

```
    WARNING in Conflict: Multiple assets emit different content to the same filename projects/tic-tac-toe/index.html
```

This is because file-loader and HtmlWebpackPlugin both try to write to that file. HtmlWebpackPlugin already handles writing the html to the same place as the compiled code, so I don't need it anymore. (Commented-out code is removed.)

```js
const config = {
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.html$/,
                use: [
                    // {
                    //     loader: "file-loader",
                    //     options: {
                    //         name: "[path][name].[ext]",
                    //         context: "src",
                    //     },
                    // },
                    // "extract-loader",
                    "html-loader",
                ],
            },
        ],
    },
};
```

Clean up:
* remove script tags from html files
* remove html import from ts files
* use HtmlWebpackPlugin to write the html files instead of file-loader

#### Automate adding new projects

This is a tangent, but I really want to do this. As an afterthought justification, the webpack will get really big really fast if I have to add like 8 lines every time I start a new project.

Idea:
* find all files and directories in src/projects/
* filter out the valid directories
* add a entry point for each scripts/index.ts and a HtmlWebpackPlugin for each index.html file

### dependencies vs devDependency
https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file

> "dependencies": Packages required by your application in production.
> "devDependencies": Packages that are only needed for local development and testing.

So phaser is definitely a devDependency, but I might actually have more devDependencies than just that.

### Phaser doesn't look right in github pages
Phaser doesn't look right in github pages (it's a bunch of neon green boxes) because I'm loading the assets from an http url (http://labs.phaser.io) and github pages (correctly) blocks mixed content. I'm actually glad this is the case, because it would be a security risk otherwise. The full visuals must wait until I get some files in my project itself.

## Meta thoughts

I had trouble starting today. I work at 12:00 thinking about working on this project and I actually started at 16:00. On the bright side, I did start. I'm practicing starting, and remembering that I could literally write a single line of code and I'd be fine got me to start.

I set the bar too high with my first post. I won't have that kind of motivation every day and I don't have the time to be so thorough with every post if I do it every day. I still like the idea of a development blog, but I think I'll only write it for myself. Maybe eventually I'll write something for others, but I think I'll leave that to my actual personal blog.

It takes me too long to swap between committing my posts and my code separately, so I'll probably start doing a single post commit at the end and a single publish commit at the end.

Would it be faster for me to drop this project and start anew with a simpler website idea or would it be faster to finish making this website? Thinking solely about publishing games, this website is too complicated, but thinking about ease of code-share and distance between the code and the blog, I think I made the right choice. I think constant work is more important than optimal velocity (at the stage I'm at) and there's probably not a big difference in coding velocity either way, so I'll just keep going the way I'm going. (I also think I'm a worrier and this might be a non-useful worry.)

Webpack seems really set on having your entry point be a JavaScript file. I wonder if it'd be faster for me to make a react website. I bet there's some roadblocks for multiple projects within one repo & website there as well.

I questioned whether or not I should learn Phaser again. I'm definitely a worrier. Even if I learn an outdated game engine, I think I'll learn a lot, so just keep working.
