## Meta thoughts

I had trouble starting today. I work at 12:00 thinking about working on this project and I actually started at 16:00. On the bright side, I did start. I'm practicing starting, and remembering that I could literally write a single line of code and I'd be fine got me to start.

I set the bar too high with my first post. I won't have that kind of motivation every day and I don't have the time to be so thorough with every post if I do it every day. I still like the idea of a development blog, but I think I'll only write it for myself. Maybe eventually I'll write something for others, but I think I'll leave that to my actual personal blog.
