## Development strategy
I'll take a shot at test driven development. I hope this will help keep my project simple.

I used this article https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/ to write this post, but I've ready many like it in the past.

* Write a test as if I'm a demanding user actually implementing something.
* Write just enough code to make the test pass. Violate best practices. Duplicate code. Also, keep track of doubts.
* Refactor as if I'm a demanding code reviewer

Let's also put in some criteria for my tests.

My unit tests should:
* Be written before the code
* Run in less than 100ms
* Be self-contained (no database, file system, network...)

## Coding

## Rename unknown-second-project to evolution-sim

* Update src/index.html link
* Rename src/projects/unknown-second-project
* Restart `npm run server`

## Add jest

Add jest https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book/blob/master/docs/testing/jest.md
```
npm i jest @types/jest ts-jest -D

jest.config.js

module.exports = {
  "roots": [
    "<rootDir>/src"
  ],
  "testMatch": [
    "**/__tests__/**/*.+(ts|tsx|js)",
    "**/?(*.)+(spec|test).+(ts|tsx|js)"
  ],
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$": "ts-jest"
  },
}

package.json

{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
  },
}
```
