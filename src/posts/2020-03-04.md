## Development strategy
I'll take a shot at test driven development. I hope this will help keep my project simple.

I used this article https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/ to write this post, but I've ready many like it in the past.

* Write a test as if I'm a demanding user actually implementing something.
* Write just enough code to make the test pass. Violate best practices. Duplicate code. Also, keep track of doubts.
* Refactor as if I'm a demanding code reviewer

Let's also put in some criteria for my tests.

My unit tests should:
* Be written before the code
* Run in less than 100ms
* Be self-contained (no database, file system, network...)

## Coding

## Rename unknown-second-project to evolution-sim

* Update src/index.html link
* Rename src/projects/unknown-second-project
* Restart `npm run server`
