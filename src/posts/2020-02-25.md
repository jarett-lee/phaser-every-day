So it happened already, I missed a day. It's past midnight so technically I missed two days, but I'm just counting this as 2020-02-25. Time to do a single line of code today. No, to just make a decision of some kind.

I think the most important thing to work on is decoupling the graphics from the board state. I think some system of mapping system would be nice - it doesn't even have to map a graphics board to the computer board. It could map buttons to functions.
